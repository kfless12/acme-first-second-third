This is really, really well done, Kevin! 5 outta 5 ðŸ¤©
I love the use of css animations.
Your code is really clean and easy to read.
I made some really minor comments in the script.js file.
The only thing to watch out is using the camelCase convention for your function and variable names.
Otherwise, really really beautiful job!!
